# Ask me (almost) anything

*An open forum to ask prominent members of the government technology community (almost) anything*

## How it works

* A community member creates [a new issue](https://github.com/government/ask-me-anything/issues/new) with their name, title, and a brief description
* Anyone may comment on that issue with questions
* The OP may specify a specific time to dedicate to answering questions, or may answer on an ongoing basis while the issue remains open.


## Basic ground rules

* All questions and responses are public
* Keep thing respectful, professional, and informal
* Moderators may remove content if deemed inapropriate (abusive, commercial, unconstructive, etc.)
